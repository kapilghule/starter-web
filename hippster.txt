hockey is an ice sport that allows individuals with disabilities the opportunity to enjoy and participate in the popular winter sport. Sled hockey is played as a team sport and the concepts and rules are the same as “stand-up” hockey. Instead of standing up to skate, participants sit on an adaptive device known as a sled. To propel themselves, players use two shortened hockey sticks with a blade on one end and metal picks for propulsion on the other end.
